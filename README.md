# Probabilistic-Machine-Learning
A collection of reports concerning probabilistic algorithms used in machine learning:

1) Using Gaussian Process regression with different kernels (RBF, periodic, and compounds of the two)

2) Using the TrueSkill ranking system on professional tennis players as listed in the ATP tennis rankings - probabilistic comparisions are generated via Gibbs' sampling alone, expectation-propagation, or Gibbs' sampling with message passing

3) A generative probabilistic text model trained and tested on datasets of documents belonging to different topics - methods include a simple multinomial model, a Bayesian Mixture of Categoricals model, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
